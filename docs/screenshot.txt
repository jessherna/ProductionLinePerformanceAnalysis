This is a placeholder for the Production Line Control System Demo screenshot.

In a real implementation, this would be replaced with an actual screenshot image (screenshot.png)
showing the system's dashboard in operation with charts, control panels, and real-time data display.

The screenshot would showcase:
1. The main dashboard with production metrics
2. Real-time sensor data visualization
3. Anomaly detection alerts
4. Production line status indicators
5. Order management interface
